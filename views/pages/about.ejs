                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm Robert a full stack software development student at Origin Code Academy and self-taught,
                        freelance illustrator and graphic designer focused on programming, art, and where
                        the two intersect.

                        <br>
                        As a software developer, I'm interested in front-end functionality, styling, and 
                        learning more about managing databases. Artistically, I aspire to illustrate books, comics, 
                        and collaborate with musicians to create promotional materials such as posters, merchandise, 
                        websites, and particularly album art.

                        <br>
                        Born and raised in San Diego, California, I keep busy by playing the 
                        accordion and <a href='http://thewrithers.com'>performing music</a> with my friends.
